# Aconso HR Document Box Sync

The [Aconso HR Document Box](https://www.aconso.com/hr-software/hr-document-box/) is a service used by some companies to make certain documents available for download for their employees.

However, as an employee the service is quite impractical:
- You can download only one document at a time (instead of all unread documents at once)
- If you download a document it will always be called "document.pdf" instead of some meaningful name 

This makes downloading and organizing the documents offline tedious.

This application "fixes" that:
- It can download all documents at once into a specified directory.
- Documents already downloaded will automatically be skipped
- It assigns meaningful filenames

This application is in no way affiliated or endorsed by Aconso.
